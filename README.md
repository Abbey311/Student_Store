## Week 2 Assignment: Student Store

Submitted by: **Abbey Yared**


### Application Features

#### CORE FEATURES

- [x] The API should contain an endpoint that serves an array of all products in the store
- [x] A Store model should handle all data management logic for the API and be the interface for read/write operations to the JSON file.
- [x] The frontend should include a landing page that displays the products available for purchase.
- [ ] Each product should have an individual page that shows the details of the product

#### STRETCH FEATURES

- [ ] Deploy your website with Heroku & Surge. 
- [ ] An endpoint should exist for creating orders and saving them to a JSON file. Each order should contain the email of the person placing the order, the items associated with the order, and the quantity of each item purchased.
- [ ] There should be a `Sidebar` component that appears on every page and has two states - `open` and `closed`. When the sidebar is opened, it should display a shopping cart of all the products the user currently has in their cart. It should also calculate and display the total amount in dollars for the checked-out items. When it's closed, the sidebar should be much thinner and not display its internal content.
- [ ] A checkout form should be available that allows the user to enter their email and send their order to the API.
- [ ] Create an endpoint for fetching all orders in the database, and an endpoint for serving an individual order based on its id.
- [ ] Create an endpoint that serves only a single product based on the product's id
- [ ] Build a page in the UI that displays the list of all past orders and lets the user click on any individual order to take them to a more detailed page of the transaction.
- [ ] Allow users to use an input to filter orders by the email of the person who placed the order.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in labs helped prepare me as I became more familiar with javascript, CSS, and HTML. The banking lab was very useful as it helped me learn how to connect both the frontend and backend in order to make a functioning website. I don't think I felt unprepared, but rather ran out of time for certain features. I believe if I had more time, I would have been able to complete all features.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have made my page look more aesthetically pleasing, and would have implemented all of the stretch features. I would have loved to include a shopping cart feature, as well as the sidebar component. I also would have liked to deploy to heroku and to have made the checkout form, because it would allow users to actually use my website.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

My project demo went well, and I displayed all of the features I had at the time. However, I wish I was better prepared because there were still components that were unfinished during the time of my presentation. I noticed that my peers made their projects unique and added their own components to make their webpage original, which is something I will definitely want to do in the future.


### Shout out

I want to give a shoutout to Diego and Taylor. Diego agreed to hop on a zoom call with me on friday night so we could help each other debug our code as we were facing similar problems. Taylor decided to help us after hours, which I am very grateful for, and is something I believe deserves a huge shoutout!
